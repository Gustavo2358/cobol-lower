# CardDemo values and remaining entry/control semantics

- id: CARDDEMO-VALUES-CONTROL
- status: IN_PROGRESS (implementation qualified; review/merge pending)
- scope: the four capability families authorized after W8; separate review PRs, no merge authorization.

## Checkpoints

1. **VC0 — discovery and independent oracles.** Reproduce each family through
   frontend → SP → lower → AIR → CFG → dependencies, under both unspecified
   logical storage and the explicit IBM physical profile. Distinguish missing
   value facts, admission, control and source qualification. Successful process
   exits are not semantic PASS.
2. **VC1 — MOVE receiver sequences.** Preserve receiving order, sending operand
   evaluation, alias-family coherence, fitting and unaffected data. Cover
   literals, figuratives and data sources; retain explicit limits for conversions
   and overlap whose result the language does not define.
3. **VC2 — indexed text.** Publish source-proved table selection and initial text
   slices with identities and uncertainty. Unknown index is a set of possible
   in-range elements plus an open remainder, never arbitrary neighboring data.
4. **VC3 — expressions and special registers.** Separate pure text transforms
   from runtime inputs and implicit runtime state. Known receiver effects must
   not poison unrelated data. Do not invent CURRENT-DATE values or treat a
   compiler register as a user storage declaration.
5. **VC4 — external control and entries.** Model lexical SQL WHENEVER directives,
   dynamic SQL completion/effects, CICS condition dispatch and alternate entries
   at their canonical owners. An alternate entry is not an edge from the primary
   entry. Preserve handler/caller context and unavailable external effects.
6. **VC5 — qualification and review.** All 73 CardDemo programs, PERFORM 39,
   Chaos 48, aliases 14, PERFORM adversaries 25, frontend fixture corpus and CICS
   qualification; changed-repository FAST and impact-selected local full gates.
   Investigate each lost candidate/support using positive kill/exclusion evidence.

Each implementation checkpoint records its contract, tests, exact pins and known
limits. Commit checkpoints progressively. No shared routine bodies (point 5),
ALTER, UI changes, fabricated CFG edges, candidate injection or weakened oracle.

## Rule and ownership

IBM Enterprise COBOL 6.4 [MOVE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.4.0?topic=statements-move-statement)
requires receiving order and evaluates sending subscripts/reference modification
and functions before the first receiving transfer. Receivers evaluate their own
selection immediately before their transfer. Overlap does not grant a defined
copy result. These are LANGUAGE_GUARANTEED premises, not corpus observations.

The frontend owns binding, source layout, expression classification and COBOL
control. SP transports typed canonical facts. Lowering composes existing generic
AIR operations where sufficient; CFG projects actual AIR terminators. Source
qualification may preserve possibilities but cannot manufacture executable flow.
Synthetic IBM declarations remain modelAssumed and never prove runtime values,
physical layout, branch exclusion or a strong kill.

## Validation design

Derive focal expected behavior from language rules before implementation. Assert
values, ordering, reachability and provenance rather than operation counts alone.
Challenge aliasing, unknown values, missing inputs, nesting and alternate routes.
Preserve raw RED outputs and use separate directories for GREEN runs. Reuse W8
baseline evidence only while its assumptions remain valid; mark reused evidence
explicitly. Whole-corpus counts are telemetry, not a replacement for the oracle.

Discovery records and raw products: workspace `.carddemo-values-control/evidence`.
VC0 starts from the merged W8 mains; the baseline manifest and runtime are frozen
in `.carddemo-values-control/baseline.json`.

## VC1 checkpoint — logical receiver sequences

The canonical storage analysis now prepares logical MOVE sequence facts. Data
sources require all receivers to have a proved logical family distinct from the
sending family. Literal text and SPACES may admit individual receivers. SPACES
normalizes to the space character and fits each receiving extent; the explicit
IBM1047 profile also receives its encoded bytes. LOW/HIGH and numeric conversion
are not inferred from this text rule.

Projection transports these facts and keeps the source logical identity on every
transfer. Lowering updates each root and all its alias views before the following
receiver. Operation IDs distinguish transfers. Undefined/unproved overlap keeps
its existing conservative boundary. There is no new CFG rule.

The proof pass is linear in the receiver count plus emitted fitted text. Lowering
is linear in receivers times affected alias views, with ordinary finite AIR text
expressions. The disjoint-family requirement is conservative: same-family data
copies remain outside this extension even if their individual ranges might be
disjoint.

New evidence: five frontend semantic tests (including physical SPACE encoding),
five real SP → AIR receiver/alias oracles integrated into LogicalTextStorageSuite,
and five four-stage probes with expected candidates. All passed. Existing frontend
FAST passed 648 tests before registering the new class; lower FAST including the
new oracles passed. Final campaign gates/corpus are pending. RED evidence is
`vc1-red-02.log`; GREEN focal evidence is `vc1-front-05.log`,
`vc1-probes-01/`, and `vc1-lower-fast-02.log` in the campaign evidence directory.

In the SPACES probe, prior program names disappear only after the now-executable
full receiving write. This is a positive kill, not exclusion based on missing
evidence. The campaign remains IN_PROGRESS; VC2–VC5 are not qualified yet.

## VC2/VC3 source expression rule

Source-qualified text facts will carry a closed expression tree rather than
COBOL function names interpreted downstream. The initial operators are ASCII
uppercase and SPACE trimming. The frontend selects these operators from typed
function syntax; unsupported functions remain UNKNOWN. The evaluator preserves
each input support and modelAssumed confidence and applies receiving fitting
after expression evaluation. Current date and RETURN-CODE stay runtime unknown.

IBM [TRIM](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.4.0?topic=functions-trim)
and [case conversion](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.4.0?topic=strings-converting-data-items-intrinsic-functions)
are the language authority. ASCII-only uppercase is an explicitly bounded
implementation domain; other characters retain an open remainder. This is
source conditional evidence, not permission to infer physical storage or prune
a branch based on synthetic declarations. Evaluation walks a finite expression
tree and transforms finite candidate sets; existing work limits remain explicit.

Adversaries cover nested transforms, all spaces, non-ASCII input, unknown input,
model assumptions, fitting after TRIM, provenance through reads, and forged
operators/arity. The pre-change TRIM and UPPER-CASE four-stage probes expose the
missing new candidate independently of the contract representation.

## VC3 checkpoint — bounded MOVE effects and source expressions

SP 2.58 adds MOVE_TARGETS: known data reads and receiving MAY effects, no MUST,
exposure proof or known runtime result. Missing receiving bindings retain ALL.
CURRENT-DATE and RETURN-CODE are runtime input/output, never fabricated names.
SP 2.59 adds NOMINAL_TEXT_SOURCE_V3 expression trees; qualified-source 1.3 carries
them unchanged. Dependencies remains 2.7 with the versioned nested certificate.
V1/V2 leaf wire shapes are unchanged. Typed ports, JSON adapters and independent
schema checks reject unknown operators, bad arity, foreign reads and downgrades.

TRIM has typed LEADING/TRAILING modifiers in the AST. Previously those valid
forms produced two parser errors and lost subsequent statements. New witnesses
require zero parser errors and preserve the following CALL. Uppercase is bounded
to ASCII; non-ASCII and unsupported functions retain uncertainty. Transforms run
before receiving fit and preserve transitive supports and modelAssumed. Source
conditional candidates do not grant executable AIR values or synthetic kills.

Focused frontend tests passed (14: six effects, five receiver sequences, three
expression tests). Four-stage probes recovered PROGB001 for TRIM, UPPER-CASE,
and nested transforms. TRIM TRAILING deliberately does not remove a leading
space; after fitting the witness does not gain PROGB001. Strict independent
qualified-source 1.3 checks passed all three direction/nesting products.

Validation records: vc3-direction-front-01.log, vc3-expression-probes-02,
vc3-direction-green. The first lower FAST exposed a future-version oracle using
2.58 as unsupported; it now tests known 2.58/2.59 and unsupported 2.60. CFG FAST
exposed the corresponding 1.3 future-version assumption (now 1.4) and a compiled
public API inventory delta. The refreshed inventory contains the intended Term
arguments API and no forbidden dependency. Rerun results are recorded separately.

One VC1 overlap adversary used the reserved word SAME and was invalid COBOL. It
now uses SRC-ALIAS and asserts valid grammar before publication; the corrected
overlap test passes. This fixes test evidence, not the production overlap rule.

The 73-program VC1 CardDemo replay passed all four stages with no candidate loss,
no support loss/change and no additions versus W8. This evidence predates VC3;
final campaign-wide qualification remains pending.

VC3 validation update: frontend FAST passed 662 tests, zero failures/skips
(vc3-front-fast-02.log). Its first run caught a real dynamic-slice invariant
regression; MOVE_TARGETS is now restricted to whole receiving references, keeping
the pre-existing conservative path for indexed/refmodified receivers. The JSON
writer now uses closed typed transport records, as required by the architecture
oracle. Existing expected values were preserved. Lower fast focal suites passed
(vc3-lower-focal-03.log), including new MOVE proof forgery and expression wire
round trips. CFG architecture FAST passed after refreshing the reviewed compiled
API inventory (vc3-expression-cfg-fast-03.log). Final full/corpus and pin gates
remain campaign obligations.

VC4 SQL checkpoint: adjacent EXEC SQL blocks are separate AST statements;
WHENEVER categories use lexical replacement and canonical procedure bindings.
Dynamic PREPARE, EXECUTE and EXECUTE IMMEDIATE retain normal completion plus
unknown outcomes, with open external effects. No runtime SQL string is analyzed.
36 focused frontend tests passed. Seven real SP fixtures pass lower reachability
oracles, and all seven pass four production stages, zero parser errors, strict
qualified-source wire validation and program candidate oracles. Cases include
lexically active but runtime-dead directives, canceled directives, dead SQL,
unresolved labels and a performed paragraph. Evidence: vc4-sql-front-02.log,
vc4-sql-lower.log, vc4-sql-probes-01/oracle.json. These tests use published
statement identities; no ordinal is assumed from a statement's source position.
Remaining VC4 CICS condition state and alternate entries are not yet implemented.

## Source table text — SP 2.60 / qualified source 1.4

NOMINAL_TEXT_SOURCE_V4 adds `tableFields`. Each field has a real storage node
identity and initializer values linked to real declaration origins. The frontend
uses typed DISPLAY character extents, fixed OCCURS bounds and proved REDEFINES
components. Numeric DISPLAY columns participate in offsets; their contents are
not program names. No physical memory capability is asserted.

This is an index-insensitive summary of each textual field and its overlapping
textual aliases. Valid constant indices and unknown indices admit the field's
possible occurrences, with an open remainder. An invalid constant index does not
publish a query. Every update to a summary is weak; conditions over the summary
cannot eliminate elements. Copying a table value preserves the predecessor
snapshot, initializer/assignment supports and index uncertainty. Model VALUEs
cannot initialize this analysis or grant a kill proof.

Only typed literal group writes are sliced in the producer. Unsupported partial
writes, ODO, non-DISPLAY geometry and unproved overlays remain unknown. A bounded
summary can retain obsolete names; it cannot certify an occurrence-specific kill.
No lower or CFG code reads declaration syntax, member names or statement text.

The wire uses a closed V4 variant; old nominal authorities reject table fields
and CHOICE terms. Source evidence 1.4 is required, preserving older envelopes and
requiring full declaration provenance. These facts do not change AIR or CFG.

IBM authorities: [OCCURS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3.0?topic=entry-occurs-clause),
[subscripting](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3.0?topic=table-subscripting),
[REDEFINES](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3.0?topic=entry-redefines-clause).


VC2 checkpoint evidence: 73/73 CardDemo programs completed all four stages
(vc2-carddemo-02). Preservation audit: zero lost candidates, zero support
losses/changes, 42 new menu candidates across the five indexed occurrences.
The separate COSGN00C addition in COPAUS0C predates VC2 and is explained by its
existing literal MOVE at source line 669 becoming visible after bounded MOVE
effect admission; control topology, storage and nominal facts were unchanged.
The raw support traces this candidate to the existing AIR value producer.

Ten table probes passed exact candidate and strict source-wire oracles, including
before/after writes, dead writes, cross-root isolation, nested OCCURS, aliases and
the uninitialized occurrence. Every result retains valueRemainder. Seven focused
frontend tests include an alias sharing synthetic model geometry. Five real SPs
pass lower round trips, identity/version forgeries and byte-equal AIR with source
facts removed. Four new source evaluator adversaries pass; CFG architecture FAST
passed 650 tests. Frontend FAST passed 672 tests before the final model-propagation
adversary; focused tests were rerun afterward. Lower FAST focal suites pass.
Compiled API inventories were refreshed only for the typed table records/codec.
Final campaign qualification remains pending, including CICS/ENTRY changes.


## VC4 alternate entries — rule and implementation plan

IBM Enterprise COBOL 6.4 [ENTRY](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.4.0?topic=statements-entry-statement)
starts an external activation at the next executable statement after the named
declaration. Sequential execution treats the declaration as neutral. Alternate
entries are prohibited in nested programs and with PROCEDURE DIVISION RETURNING;
USING does not supply actual runtime values or an exact parameter contract.

The producer will retain the declaration's typed literal/parameter surface and
publish each valid alternate root in controlTopology.entryPoints, linked by entry
identity and proof. Entry inventory owns names/signatures; topology owns starts.
Unresolved/invalid surfaces retain entry gaps. These are separate external roots,
not primary-entry successors. Lowering will create one AIR entry per supported
root, with separate activation IDs and bootstrap/state. PERFORM completion still
binds to the invoking activation. The source state graph will seed each entry
independently and identify its root authority; CFG continues to project AIR only.

Independent oracles: a primary GOBACK cannot reach an alternate body; alternate
activation cannot execute pre-ENTRY statements; sequential flow can cross ENTRY;
consecutive declarations share the next executable start; USING stays unknown;
nested/invalid declarations cannot fabricate entries; separate PERFORM callers
return to their own continuations. New contracts and negative wire tests will
reject old-version, missing-proof, foreign-entry and metadata/topology conflicts.

ENTRY adversary with an unbound LINKAGE target exposed an executable read of a
nominal object whose only location bound was itself. I-13 correctly rejected it.
The translator now keeps that nominal inventory out of the executable data index
until an independent storage bound exists; CALL keeps its computed unknown target
and continuation. This grants neither a fabricated Cell nor a closed value set.

VC4 ENTRY checkpoint: SP 2.61 carries typed alternate declarations and proved
external starts; qualified source 1.5 carries independent alternate root authority.
Lowering emits distinct activation contexts with their own bootstrap and entry
state. Sequential ENTRY remains neutral, parameters stay unknown, and explicit
absence of RETURNING is preserved separately from parameter uncertainty. Known
unsupported/invalid declarations remain inventoried with gaps; a trailing ENTRY
without an admitted executable start retains an explicit coverage limitation.

Six frontend tests and eight real-SP lower oracles cover root isolation,
consecutive declarations, sequential flow, USING, independent values and PERFORM
returns. Six wire/in-memory forgeries challenge version, entry identity,
declaration, start and grammar proof. Eight CFG/dependency oracles pass on
vc4-entry-runtime-03, including a real LINKAGE argument with no proved address.
The earlier CardDemo replay on runtime-02 passed 73/73 x four stages with zero
candidate/support losses; the 43 cumulative additions are the already explained
VC2/VC3 additions. The final unbound-LINKAGE fix and all future CICS changes still
require the final campaign replay. No merge is authorized.

## VC4 condition dispatch — rule and bounded design

IBM CICS HANDLE CONDITION establishes a runtime registration, distinct from
lexical Db2 WHENEVER and from HANDLE ABEND. A subsequent registration replaces
only its condition. An omitted label requests the system default and suppresses
ERROR fallback for that condition. IGNORE requests continuation. RESP/NOHANDLE
suppress handlers for that command; a LINK callee does not inherit registrations.
The selected label branches in the current COBOL activation and keeps the
registration active; it does not manufacture a PERFORM return or deactivate like
an ABEND handler. PGMIDERR on LINK/XCTL has default task-abend disposition.

The producer publishes typed registration updates and condition events with
resolved topology targets, condition continuation and grammar/resolution proofs.
SP 2.62 and qualified source 1.6 carry these new facts. The existing finite
state tabulation will track reaching definitions for event-relevant conditions
plus ERROR, preserving each registration origin. Replacement is a positive kill
of that registration only. Unknown external calls open the current definitions,
retaining their possible targets. The initial state remains unknown.

This capability admits PGMIDERR events on structurally supported LINK/XCTL and
HANDLE/IGNORE registrations. Other condition event families and PUSH/POP HANDLE
stacks remain explicit gaps, with no invented stack restoration. Only PGMIDERR
and ERROR state components are demanded, so the finite product has at most
O((P+1)(E+1)(A+1)) support states before bounded context tabulation, where P/E/A
are distinct specific/general/ABEND registrations. No runtime path enumeration.

Independent oracles must challenge registration without event, dead registration,
replacement, omitted label, ERROR fallback, IGNORE, RESP/NOHANDLE, two event
occurrences, PERFORM continuation, ordinary label reachability, ABEND coexistence
and unknown external calls. Positive branch selection remains a possibility;
no test may pretend a PGMIDERR necessarily occurs.

Authorities: [HANDLE CONDITION](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/6.x?topic=summary-handle-condition),
[IBM CICS command reference](https://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/dfhp400.pdf),
[CICS Primer](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSJL4D_6.x/pdf/cics-primer.pdf).

LINK ordinary completion is independent of handler disposition: a successful
LINK can return even when PGMIDERR would branch or abend. The producer publishes
that normal route for the same bounded command surface as the condition event.
Lowering consumes the route and retains partial target/signature/effect facts.
An event-only test exposed that retaining the old handler-unknown cut would
otherwise publish the exceptional path while losing the successful return.

Adversarial boundary: an unmodeled POP HANDLE can restore an earlier condition
registration. Treating the latest known registration as a proved kill after that
boundary is invalid. The producer therefore publishes only CONTROL_POSSIBILITY
relations from eligible events to locally resolved condition labels and the error
continuation, conditional on a reachable POP HANDLE occurrence. The ordinary
source hypothesis opens the current condition state. This deliberately does not
model a stack or add AIR/CFG edges; candidates remain possible with their source
assumptions. Dead POP and RESP/NOHANDLE must not activate these relations. The
finite publication is O(events × POP occurrences × local condition targets).

## Review qualification — 2026-09-28

VC1–VC4 are implemented and qualified in separate worktrees with progressive
commits. Review/integration remains IN_PROGRESS; this campaign has no merge
permission. Point 5 (sharing routine bodies) remains a separate campaign.

### Causes and delivered behavior

| Family | Cause | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MOVE receivers | Logical transfer admission and alias updates did not compose the receiver sequence | Typed per-receiver facts, captured sender and ordered coherent alias updates |
| Indexed targets | Source values did not represent table fields or declaration slices | Producer-owned fixed table geometry, index-insensitive text unions and weak table/alias writes |
| Functions/registers | Unsupported sender forms opened excessive memory/control uncertainty | Receiver-bounded MAY effects; typed UPPER-CASE/TRIM source expressions; runtime registers stay unknown |
| External control/entries | SQL directives/dynamic forms, alternate roots and condition state were absent or conflated with ordinary completion | Lexical WHENEVER, dynamic SQL continuation, isolated ENTRY roots, runtime PGMIDERR/ERROR dispatch and independent LINK success |

### Executed qualification

- 560/560 sources completed SP → AIR → CFG → dependencies: 331 frontend
  fixtures, all 73 CardDemo programs, PERFORM 39, Chaos 48, aliases 14,
  PERFORM adversaries 25 and CICS 30.
- Existing exact semantic oracles: PERFORM 39/39, Chaos 48/48 and 28 rejected
  negative mutations, aliases 14/14, PERFORM adversaries 25/25.
- Preservation comparison across all 560: **zero candidate losses and zero
  support/provenance losses**. 43 additions: 42 menu candidates at five indexed
  occurrences, plus COSGN00C in COPAUS0C from its existing literal MOVE becoming
  visible after bounded MOVE effect admission. No name-table injection.
- Final runtime focal oracles: 20 condition dispatch, eight entry isolation,
  ten table and seven SQL, 14 MOVE/function/register, and three unknown-stack
  restoration cases. Java gates also reject forged versions, identities,
  proofs and bypass facts. Four physical table adversaries from VC2 are reused:
  later changes affect entry/CICS control, absent from those sources.
- Frontend FAST passed; final qualification-local passed 1,257 Maven tests,
  source-normalizer full regression and naming. One future semantic-condition
  oracle is guarded by the pre-existing absent system property
  semantic.condition.required (1,258 discovered, one skipped).
- Lower mandatory FAST passed: 2,481 core checks, fixed adapter families,
  architecture and harness checks.
- CFG FAST components passed 653 required methods (zero skipped), architecture,
  strict transport readers and remaining Python gates. The wrapper found
  an obsolete future-version test using 1.3; it now explicitly accepts 1.3–1.6
  and rejects incompatible downgrades and future 1.7. That reader and every
  remaining gate were rerun successfully. Exact-head remote FAST is reported
  in the PR; an unexecuted local full gate is not reported as passed.

The compiled architecture inventories changed only for the new ConditionState
record, Support constructor/getter and their references. A read-only diff was
reviewed before the official refresh. No denied dependency, existing class or
semantic oracle was removed. Historical capability tests now require the new
entry/event facts; their primary-flow and PARTIAL assertions remain.

### Graphs and evidence reuse

All 73 graphs were traversed by published identities. Total unreachable nodes
remain 27,661 and zero-incoming non-entry nodes remain seven; no program gained
either category. The five changed graphs add 512 reachable nodes and 1,429
transitions. COACTUPC remains 5,037/5,037 reachable with one component; its UniKix
variant remains 4,968/4,968. These observations do not claim that every unreachable
context is erroneous or that point 5 has been implemented.

Raw evidence stays in workspace .carddemo-values-control/evidence: vc-final-01,
vc-final-02, vc-final-qualification, vc-final-probes, vc-final-other-probes and
the gate logs. The checked-in qualification JSON records exact production
checkpoints, source-tree hash and report hashes.
The corpus used frozen runtime 05. Runtime 06 changes only one compiled producer
class, adding resolution provenance to unknown-restoration hypotheses. None of
the 560 products contains that rule, so their evidence is reused for this final
delta; all restoration adversaries were rerun on runtime 06. Previous W8 products
are retained only as the historical comparison baseline.

Full lower/CFG qualification wrappers were not run: fixed FAST, admission/wire
adversaries, source-value laws and the complete 560-case cross-repo corpus cover
the changed boundary. Frontend full was run because shared grammar/AST ownership
changed. AIR, CFG construction, UI and ALTER semantics are unchanged.

### Remaining bounds

- Same-family MOVE overlap without language proof and unsupported conversions
  remain open. Functions add ASCII UPPER-CASE and TRIM; arbitrary functions and
  runtime registers do not acquire invented values or MUST kills.
- Tables summarize fixed OCCURS and supported DISPLAY text geometry. Dynamic
  bounds, arbitrary physical overlays and exact per-index dataflow remain open.
- Alternate entry parameters/linkage state remain partial; invalid/trailing roots
  do not acquire invented executable starts.
- SQL runtime text is not parsed into dependencies; procedure-level WHENEVER
  scope is supported, with missing targets and external effects kept explicit.
- PGMIDERR on LINK/XCTL and ERROR fallback are admitted. Other CICS event families
  and exact PUSH/POP stack execution remain outside this capability. Unknown
  restoration preserves source candidates with assumptions, never fake AIR edges.

## Review corrections — causal restoration and condition names (IN_PROGRESS)

The review witnesses reproduce seven incorrect restored-handler candidates and
three losses of table candidates on the reviewed heads. All fifteen probes parse
without errors and complete all four stages; five controls already pass.

IBM HANDLE CONDITION replaces the previous disposition for the same condition;
POP can influence only subsequent execution in the same activation. We will
keep the existing source-only hypothesis catalogue, but carry its eligibility
forward as finite reaching facts inside the existing contextual state engine.
The POP completion introduces a fact. A proved later specific disposition kills
all hypotheses for that event condition; an ERROR update kills only restored
ERROR targets, preserving possible specific dispositions. Joins keep alternatives,
PERFORM passes facts through matched calls/returns, and alternate entries start
independently. No exact stack or executable edge is introduced.

The internal reaching facts identify existing published continuations. They are
not a new source wire capability: the published derivation graph retains the
causal path and CONTROL_POSSIBILITY proof. Their inclusion in context/state keys
prevents merging different restoration histories. The finite domain has at most
one bit per eligible published restoration relation; ordinary products have none.
No change to ALTER or its separate prerequisite logic is authorized.

Level 88 declares condition names without storage. The table geometry traversal
and field inventory must both ignore these annotations, including when they are
children of a sibling field. No 88 VALUE is an initializer of another declaration.
IBM authority: [special level-numbers](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3.0?topic=relationships-special-level-numbers) and [condition-name VALUE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-zos/6.3?topic=vc-format-2).
Existing bounded table geometry, weak updates and modelAssumed remain unchanged.

New oracles: post-POP LABEL/IGNORE/DEFAULT and ERROR replacement, later POP,
independent ENTRY, PERFORM kill and positive return, backward GO TO and branch
join positives; direct/sibling 88 and weak writes. Existing restoration positives
and wire/reachability oracles remain mandatory. FAST on affected repos plus the
73-program CardDemo replay and neighboring PERFORM/Chaos/alias suites will check
regressions; all deltas must be traced before updating the Drafts.
